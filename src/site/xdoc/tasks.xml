      <p>
        The following are some of the proposed ideas and tasks for commons-io:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A proper user guide</li>
        <li>A URLUtils class that has many of the FileUtils operations, but for a URL</li>
        <li>FilePoller for telling when a file changes. Look in Tomcat, or GenJava[bayard] (One implemented in bugzilla awaiting investigation)</li>
        <li>A "hot folder" handler which triggers an action when a new file has been uploaded to an FTP directory, for example.</li>
        <li>JoinReader/ConcatReader. One in GenJava, one submitted to Bayard</li>
        <li>FormattedWriter, when it writes out values it uses Format objects to output them. </li>
        <li>FixedWidthReader. Reads in files with a known width, ie) mainframe like. </li>
      </ul>
