<p>
These are the release notes and advice for upgrading Commons-IO from
version 2.0 to version 2.0.1
<source>
Commons IO is a package of Java utility classes for java.io's hierarchy.  
Classes in this package are considered to be so standard and of such high 
reuse as to justify existence in java.io.

Commons IO contains utility classes, stream implementations, file filters, 
file comparators and endian transformation classes.


Compatibility with 2.0 and 1.4
------------------------------
Binary compatible - Yes

Source compatible - Yes

Semantic compatible - Yes
  Check the bug fixes section for semantic bug fixes

Commons IO 2.0.1 requires a minimum of JDK 1.5
 (Commons IO 1.4 had a minimum of JDK 1.3) 


Enhancements from 2.0
---------------------

   * [IO-256] - Provide thread factory for FileAlternationMonitor


Bug fixes from 2.0
------------------

   * [IO-257] - BOMInputStream.read(byte[]) can return 0 which it should not
   * [IO-258] - XmlStreamReader consumes the stream during encoding detection
