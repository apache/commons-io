<section name="Upgrade">
<p>
These are the release notes and advice for upgrading Commons-IO from
version 1.3, or 1.3.1, to version 1.3.2.
<source>
Commons IO is a package of Java utility classes for java.io's hierarchy.  
Classes in this package are considered to be so standard and of such high 
reuse as to justify existence in java.io.

Commons IO contains utility classes, stream implementations, file filters, 
and endian transformation classes.

Source compatible - Yes

  Check the bug fixes section for semantic bug fixes


Compatibility with 1.3

Enhancements since 1.3.1
------------------------

- Created the FileCleaningTracker, basically a non-static version of the
  FileCleaner, which can be controlled by the user. [IO-116]
- The FileCleaner is deprecated. (For reasons of compatibility, the
  deprecation warnings are hidden within the 1.3 branch. They'll be
  visible, as of version 1.4.)


Bug fixes from 1.3.1

- Some tests, which are implicitly assuming a Unix-like file system, are
  now skipped on Windows. [IO-115]
