<section name="Upgrade">
<p>
These are the release notes and advice for upgrading Commons-IO from
version 2.2 to version 2.3
<source>
Commons IO is a package of Java utility classes like java.io.  
Classes in this package are considered to be so standard and of such high 
reuse as to justify existence in java.io.

The Commons IO library contains utility classes, stream implementations, file filters, 
file comparators, endian transformation classes, and much more.
