<section name="Upgrade">
<p>
These are the release notes and advice for upgrading Commons-IO from
version 1.3 to version 1.3.1.
<source>
Commons IO is a package of Java utility classes for java.io's hierarchy.  
Classes in this package are considered to be so standard and of such high 
reuse as to justify existence in java.io.

and endian transformation classes.
