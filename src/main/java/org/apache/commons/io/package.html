This package defines utility classes for working with streams, readers,
writers and files. The most commonly used classes are described here:
</p>
<p>
<b>IOUtils</b> is the most frequently used class.
It provides operations to read, write, copy and close streams.
</p>
<p>
<b>FileUtils</b> provides operations based around the JDK File class.
These include reading, writing, copying, comparing and deleting.
</p>
<p>
<b>FilenameUtils</b> provides utilities based on filenames.
This utility class manipulates filenames without using File objects.
It aims to simplify the transition between Windows and Unix.
Before using this class however, you should consider whether you should
be using File objects.
</p>
<p>
<b>FileSystemUtils</b> allows access to the filing system in ways the JDK
does not support. At present this allows you to get the free space on a drive.
</p>
<p>
<b>EndianUtils</b> swaps data between Big-Endian and Little-Endian formats.
