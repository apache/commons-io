/**
 * An unsynchronized version of {@link BufferedInputStream}, not thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * Wraps an existing {@link InputStream} and <em>buffers</em> the input. Expensive interaction with the underlying input stream is minimized, since most
 * (smaller) requests can be satisfied by accessing the buffer alone. The drawback is that some extra space is required to hold the buffer and that copying
 * takes place when filling that buffer, but this is usually outweighed by the performance benefits.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To build an instance, see {@link Builder}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A typical application pattern for the class looks like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * UnsynchronizedBufferedInputStream s = new UnsynchronizedBufferedInputStream.Builder().
 *   .setInputStream(new FileInputStream(&quot;file.java&quot;))
 *   .setBufferSize(8192)
 *   .get();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Provenance: Apache Harmony and modified.
