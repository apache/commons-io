/**
 * A reader decorator that tags potential exceptions so that the
 * reader that caused the exception can easily be identified. This is
 * done by using the {@link TaggedIOException} class to wrap all thrown
 * {@link IOException}s. See below for an example of using this class.
 * <pre>
 * TaggedReader reader = new TaggedReader(...);
 * try {
 *     // Processing that may throw an IOException either from this reader
 *     // or from some other IO activity like temporary files, etc.
 *     processReader(reader);
 * } catch (IOException e) {
 *     if (reader.isCauseOf(e)) {
 *         // The exception was caused by this reader.
 *         // Use e.getCause() to get the original exception.
 *     } else {
 *         // The exception was caused by something else.
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, the {@link #throwIfCauseOf(Throwable)} method can be
 * used to let higher levels of code handle the exception caused by this
 * reader while other processing errors are being taken care of at this
 * lower level.
 * <pre>
 * TaggedReader reader = new TaggedReader(...);
 * try {
 *     processReader(reader);
 * } catch (IOException e) {
 *     reader.throwIfCauseOf(e);
 *     // ... or process the exception that was caused by something else
