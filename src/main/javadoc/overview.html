<h1>Apache Commons IO</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Apache Commons IO component contains utility classes,
filters, streams, readers and writers.
</p>
<p>
These classes aim to add to the standard JDK IO classes.
The utilities provide convenience wrappers around the JDK, simplifying
various operations into pre-tested units of code.
The filters and streams provide useful implementations that perhaps should
be in the JDK itself.
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Java 8 or above.</li>
<li>If using OSGi, R7 or above.</li>
</ul>
