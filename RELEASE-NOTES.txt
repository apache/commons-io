file comparators, endian transformation classes, and much more.

Java 8 is required.

Apache Commons IO Version 2.6

Introduction
------------

Apache Commons IO is a package of Java utility classes like java.io.
Classes in this package are considered to be so standard and of such high
reuse as to justify existence in java.io.

The Apache Commons IO library contains utility classes, stream implementations,
file filters, file comparators, endian transformation classes, and much more.

Apache Commons IO 2.6 requires at least Java 7 to build and run.

DEPRECATIONS
============

All closeQuietly overloads in org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils have been
deprecated. Use the try-with-resources statement or handle suppressed
exceptions manually.

The class org.apache.commons.io.FileSystemUtils has been deprecated.
Use equivalent methods in java.nio.file.FileStore instead, e.g.
Files.getFileStore(Paths.get("/home")).getUsableSpace() or iterate over
FileSystems.getDefault().getFileStores().

COMPATIBILITY WITH JAVA 9
==================

The MANIFEST.MF now contains an additional entry:

  Automatic-Module-Name: org.apache.commons.io

This should make it possible to use Commons IO 2.6 as a module in the Java 9
module system. For more information see the corresponding issue:

    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IO-551

Building Commons IO 2.6 should work out of the box with the latest Java 9
release. Please report any Java 9 related issues at:

    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IO

* IO-551: Add Automatic-Module-Name MANIFEST entry for Java 9 compatibility.

Semantic compatible - Yes
  Check the bug fixes section for semantic bug fixes

Deprecations from 1.2
---------------------
- WildcardFilter deprecated, replaced by WildcardFileFilter
  - old class only accepted files, thus had a confusing dual purpose

  - freeSpace returns a result that varies by operating system and
    thus isn't that useful
  - freeSpaceKb returns much better and more consistent results
  - freeSpaceKb existed in v1.2, so this is a gentle cutover

Bug fixes from 1.2
------------------
- LineIterator now implements Iterator
  - It was always supposed to...

    throws an IOException if the last modified date cannot be changed

- FileCleaner
  - This now handles the situation where an error occurs when deleting the file

- IOUtils.copy [IO-84]
  - Copy methods could return inaccurate byte/char count for large streams
  - The copy(InputStream, OutputStream) method now returns -1 if the count is greater than an int
  - The copy(Reader, Writer) method now throws now returns -1 if the count is greater than an int
  - Added a new copyLarge(InputStream, OutputStream) method that returns a long
  - Added a new copyLarge(Reader, Writer) method that returns a long

- CountingInputStream/CountingOutputStream [IO-84]
  - Methods were declared as int thus the count was inaccurate for large streams
  - new long based methods getByteCount()/resetByteCount() added
  - existing methods changed to throw an exception if the count is greater than an int

- FileBasedTestCase
  - Fixed bug in compare content methods identified by GNU classpath

- EndianUtils.writeSwappedLong(byte[], int) [IO-101]

  - A new method that allows the internal cleaner thread to be cleanly terminated

- WildcardFileFilter
  - Replacement for WildcardFilter
  - Accepts both files and directories
  - Ability to control case-sensitivity

- NameFileFilter
  - Ability to control case-sensitivity

  - new sizeRangeFileFilter(long minimumSize, long maximumSize) method which 
    creates a filter that accepts files within the specified size range.
