			 Commons IO Package
			    Version 1.1
			   Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

Commons IO is a package of Java utility classes for java.io's hierarchy.  
Classes in this package are considered to be so standard and of such high 
reuse as to justify existence in java.io.

Commons IO contains utility classes, stream implementations, file filters, 
and endian transformation classes.


Incompatible changes from 1.0
-----------------------------
Binary compatible - ???

Source compatible - ???

Semantic compatible - ???


Deprecations from 1.0
---------------------
- CopyUtils has been deprecated.
    Its methods have been moved to IOUtils.
    The new IOUtils methods handle nulls better, and have clearer names.

- IOUtils.toByteArray(String) - Use {@link String#getBytes()}
- IOUtils.toString(byte[]) - Use {@link String#String(byte[])}
- IOUtils.toString(byte[],String) - Use {@link String#String(byte[],String)}


Bug fixes from 1.0
------------------
- FileUtils - touch()  [29821]
    Now creates the file if it did not previously exist

- FileUtils - toFile(URL)  [32575]
    Now handles escape syntax such as %20

- FileFilterUtils - makeCVSAware(IOFileFilter)  [33023]
    Fixed bug that caused method to be completely broken

- CountingInputStream  [33336]
    Fixed bug that caused the count to reduce by one at the end of the stream

- CountingInputStream - skip(long)  [34311]
    Bytes from calls to this method were not previously counted

- NullOutputStream  [33481]
    Remove unecessary synchronization

- AbstractFileFilter - accept(File, String)  [30992]
    Fixed broken implementation

- IOUtils - readLines(InputStream)  [36214]
          - readLines(InputStream,encoding)
          - readLines(Reader)
    Reads a stream/reader line by line into a List of Strings

- IOUtils - toInputStream(String)  [32958]
          - toInputStream(String,encoding)

          - writeLines(Collection,lineEnding,OutputStream,encoding)
          - writeLines(Collection,lineEnding,Writer)
    Writes a collection to a file line by line

- IOUtils - write(...)
    Write data to a stream/writer (moved from CopyUtils with better null handling)

- IOUtils - copy(...)
    Copy data between streams (moved from CopyUtils with better null handling)

- IOUtils - contentEquals(Reader,Reader)

- ConditionalFileFilter - new interface  [30705]
    Defines the behaviour of list based filters

- AndFileFilter, OrFileFilter  [30705]
    Now support a list of filters to and/or

- WildcardFilter  [31115]
    New filter that can match using wildcard file names

- FileFilterUtils - makeSVNAware(IOFileFilter)
    New method, like makeCVSAware, that ignores Subversion source control directories

- CountingInputStream,CountingOutputStream - resetCount()  [28976]
    Adds the ability to reset the count part way through reading/writing the stream

- DeferredFileOutputStream - writeTo(OutputStream)  [34173]
    New method to allow current contents to be written to a stream
